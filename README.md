# Azure Course Blueprints

## Overview
The Course Blueprint is a comprehensive visual guide to the Azure ecosystem, integrating all the resources, tools, structures, and connections covered in the course into one inclusive diagram. It enables students to map out and understand the elements they've studied, providing a clear picture of their place within the larger Azure ecosystem. It serves as a 1:1 representation of all the topics officially covered in the instructor-led training.

## Links
Each icon in the blueprint has a hyperlink to the pertinent document in the learning path on Learn.

## Layers
You have the capability to filter layers to concentrate on segments of the course by modules. For example, just day 1 of AZ-104, using filters in Visio and selecting modules 1-3.

## Enhanced Integration
The Visio Template+ for expert courses like SC-100 and AZ-305 now includes an additional layer that enables you to compare SC-100, AZ-500, and SC-300 within the same diagram. Similarly, you can compare any combination of AZ-305, AZ-700, AZ-204, and AZ-104 to identify differences and study gaps.

## Advantages for Students
- **Defined Goals**: The blueprint presents learners with a clear vision of what they are expected to master and achieve by the course’s end.
- **Focused Learning**: By spotlighting the course content and learning targets, it steers learners’ efforts towards essential areas, leading to more productive learning.
- **Progress Tracking**: The blueprint allows learners to track their advancement and assess their command of the course material.

## New Feature
A comprehensive list of topics for each slide deck is now available in a downloadable .xlsx file. Each entry includes a link to Learn and its dependencies.
